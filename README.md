# Car Data React Native App

## Description

    - Retrieve data from a car API and display it on the main page
    - implement a search function where a user can type in the car model name and will receive an output according to the search (output changes on text)
    - implement a filter option where the user can set filters however they would like (can filter based on car mode, year and color of the car as well as price range slider)
    - implemented a clear function, when pressed all filters are cleared and the user is taken back to the original screen.

## Technology used

    - for this project I have used react native to develop the app, expo and xcode to run the app locally and snack expo to upload the app.

## How to run the app locally

    - in order to run the app locally ensure you have node installed, if not please visit the link (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install nodeJS.
    - next you would want to install react-native-app on your machine run:
    ```
    npm install -g create-react-native-app
    ```
    if that doesnt work due to administration issues: run
    ```
    sudo npm install -g create-react-native-app
    ```
    that will allow your terminal to install packages as an administrator all you have to do is type in your password.
    - after you have succesfully installed node and react-native you need to install expo so that you can run the app. In order to do that run the following command in your terminal
    ```
    sudo npm install -g expo-cli
    ```
    - after this is done, you need to clone the git repository, in this case its (https://github.com/adelxh/car-data.git)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/adelxh/car-data.git
    ```
    - install the dependencies assosicated with the project
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    - then you should be able to run
    ```
    yarn start
    ```
    to start the project
    - download expo go on the app store or google play
