# Car Data React Native App

## Description

    - Retrieve data from a car API and display it on the main page
    - implement a search function where a user can type in the car model name and will receive an output according to the search (output changes on text)
    - implement a filter option where the user can set filters however they would like (can filter based on car mode, year and color of the car as well as price range slider)
    - implemented a clear function, when pressed all filters are cleared and the user is taken back to the original screen.

## Technology used

    - for this project I have used react native to develop the app, expo and xcode to run the app locally and snack expo to upload the app.

## How to run the app locally

    - in order to run the app locally ensure you have node installed, if not please visit the link (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install nodeJS.
